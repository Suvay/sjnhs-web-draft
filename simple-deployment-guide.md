# Simple OptikLink Deployment - Final Solution

## Problem: Limited Shell Commands
OptikLink has very limited shell commands available (no npm, no find).

## Solution: Use Basic Commands Only

### Option 1: Basic Copy Commands
```bash
cp -r dist/public/* ./
cp .htaccess ./
```

### Option 2: Individual File Copy (if Option 1 fails)
```bash
cp dist/public/index.html ./
cp -r dist/public/assets ./
cp .htaccess ./
```

### Option 3: No Deployment Actions (Simplest)
**Leave the deployment actions field EMPTY**

The files are already in your GitHub repository, and Plesk will place them in the correct directory automatically.

## Recommended Approach:
1. Try Option 1 first
2. If it fails, try Option 2
3. If both fail, use Option 3 (empty deployment actions)

## Your Website Files:
- `dist/public/index.html` - Main webpage
- `dist/public/assets/` - CSS, JavaScript, images
- `.htaccess` - URL routing configuration

These are already built and ready to serve from your repository.

## Result:
Your website at squidyvalour.optikl.ink should work with any of these approaches since the files are pre-built and committed to GitHub.
